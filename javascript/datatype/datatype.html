    // 1. What are the different data types present in javascript?
    // okay so, in javascript there are 2 types of data called primitive and non primitive.
    // but there 8 datatype in primitive datatype such as 

    // 1. string - it is a datatype that represent characters
    // 2. number - it represent numbers 
    // 3. BigInt - this data type is used to store numbers which are above the limitation of the number data type. it can store large integers and is represented by adding "n" to an integer literal
    // Boolean - it represents a logical entity and can have only two values true or false
    // Undefined - when a varible is declared but not assigned, it has the value of undefined and it's type is also undefined;
    // Null - it represents a non-existent or a invalid value;
    // symbol - it is a new datatype introduced in the es6 version of javascript. it is used to store an anonymous and unique value. 
    // typeof - this is used to check type of data .



    //  non primitive datatype is a datatype that used to store multiple data as in array, object. so yes array and objects are the example of non-primitive datatype.
